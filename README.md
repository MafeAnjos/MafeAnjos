- 👋 Hi, I’m @MafeAnjos, but you can call me Mafe
- 👀 I’m interested in games, series and reading, my favorite show is Gravity Falls and my favorite game is Minecraft
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of new things, from front-end to c language, I'm still very new in the coding world
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the most projects possible, as I still crave to learn Java and Python
